partsy
======

`partsy` is a small tool to match entries from a plaintext database to a [bill of materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials). With a decent database you should be able to take BOM output from your PCB-layout program (*e.g.* [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/)) and convert it directly into a list of articles with an order, ready to be sent to your supplier.
