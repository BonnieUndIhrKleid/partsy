partsy
======

`partsy` is a small tool to match entries from a plaintext database to a [bill of materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials). With a decent database you should be able to take BOM output from your PCB-layout program (*e.g.* [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/)) and convert it directly into a list of articles with an order, ready to be sent to your supplier.

This program should be considered a draft. It's working (and being used), but no guarantees are made that it will stay the way it is.

If you find it useful, please let me know; maybe we can extend it together.


Database format

Still not documented. I'm sorry.
